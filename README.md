This research focuses on applying advanced technologies such as machine learning and data analysis techniques to predict the possibility of logistics delays. 

Through the data analyzing process and machine training, a model will be built to proactively predict shipment delays based on various logistics-related attributes such as traffic conditions, weather conditions, buyer demand, etc. 

Firstly, the results of this report, suggest stakeholders a promising solution for delay prevention and operational optimization to reduce costs, enhance supply chain efficiency and increase customer satisfaction. 
Secondly, it can provide a scalable machine learning framework that can be extended to different logistics contexts, including international shipping, urban deliveries.
